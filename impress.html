<p>We live in a society in which we are more and more digitally connected to each other. In this society the public sphere is no longer produced by the mass media. More and more economic processes are happening publicly and in a networked way. Whoever is participating in society is producing content about themselves and about everything they are doing and is perceived via this content. Content strategy is nothing more than a strategic approach to this content. Content marketing means to use this content in a targeted way for marketing purposes. Brands are perceived via content because they are acting today in a networked way, publicly and in realtime.</p>
