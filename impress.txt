Why brands become publishers

# {.step .slide data-x=1000 daty-y=1000}

We live in a society in which we are more and more digitally connected to each other. In this society the public sphere is no longer produced by the mass media. More and more economic processes are happening publicly and in a networked way. Whoever is participating in society is producing content about themselves and about everything they are doing and is perceived via this content. Content strategy is nothing more than a strategic approach to this content. Content marketing means to use this content in a targeted way for marketing purposes. Brands are perceived via content because they are acting today in a networked way, publicly and in realtime.

"Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action." http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/

Content-Marketing is about content published by brands which 

1. satisfies an interest for content which does not end with the purchase of a product, 
2. supports sales. 

Content Marketing is a task for content strategists. It is closely related to other purposes of content (e.g PR, Service).

Thesen:
1. Brands today have different and by far more touch points with customers than they used to have. On the other site they are losing the traditional media channels controlled by their budget in a quasi monopolistic way.
2. Control of the digital touchpoints has been transferred to the customers. 
3. The value propositions of brands are getting more complex and more networked. Brands are perceived aus parts of a media world. The value proposition of a brand has become more complex and more networked. 
4. For these reasons brands are transformed into complex content offers. Content provides opportunities for continuous interaction from raising awareness to consolidating loyality.
5. Only radically user centered content marketing provides the chance to reach customers in a manner not limited to isolated contacts and interactions.
